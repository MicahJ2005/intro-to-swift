## New Technology Learnings
* Getting started was probably the trickiest part (Note: large download for Xcode!)
* Learned how to add images, labels, and views (regular, horizontal stack, and Vertical Stack)

### What does Swift add to my current stack?
- Swift adds a mobile feature to my current Full Stack experience. In a "mobile-friendly" world, this will be very beneficial to building accessable applications for a variety of devices.
